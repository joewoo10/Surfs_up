## Surfs Up

### Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to review weather patterns in Hawaii in preparation for the opening of a surfing and ice cream shop. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December, looking at different statistics between the two periods to assess whether an ice cream and surfing shop would have acceptable weather conditions in which to operate.
### Results:
#### The table below summarizes the June temperatures.

#### The table below summarizes the December temperatures.

#### These two tables provide some insight into the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods:

1.	Average temperatures between June and December are 75 and 71 degrees respectively, reflecting little average temperature variation between the two periods.
2.	Like the average temperature comparison, the maximum temperatures of 85 for June and 83 for December are quite close.
3.	The minimum temperature of 56 for December and 64 for June shows the greatest variance and reflects a much lower temperature in December. This may not be favorable for ice cream or surfing. 

### Summary:
Overall, the weather in December and June are historically very similar, although December has a wider range of results, with its high being close to June's but its low dipping well below that of June. Additional queries that may be helpful include precipitation variation between June and December to determine whether one has more precipitation. We could also do comparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at the different locations. Of course, we would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our probable location, which would narrow the results and provide the most relevant data for us to consider.
